  <div class="article"> <h2>My Genius Plan</h2><br><br>
       I love this work and I need a change. A big one. A don't-want-to-dread-mondays-anymore change. The plan is six months to big change.
<br><br>
<xmp>console.log(`that's ms. developer to you`);</xmp>
<br><br>
It started with a black friday sale at Code Academy. $140 to change my life. Not a bad deal. I did have a shoe in the developer world, I grew up around it and a lot of the people I know are programmers. I caught the bug for it in college. A decade later though and I'd forgotten everything. (It is like riding a bike. In case you wondered.)
<br><br>
It sort of sat there, the course I'd bought, sad and kind of forgotten for a minute. One bad break-up later and I found myself staring it again, wondering if I could still do it. It all came back so fast and I realized I do want this. 
<br><br>
It's such a high when you figure it out. That thing that should work but doesn't. The massive download of information began and the plan started taking some shape.
<br><br>
<xmp><marquee>lots of little things add up</marquee>
  <!--a cute solution but degraded--></xmp>
<br><br>
My education would invole a blend of structured course material (Codcademy), borrowed textbooks, youtube tutorial (thanks Mosh), and hands on application either with my own sites or clipped into workspaces for furture reference. All of this taken down by hand in my notebook for remembering and then re-written in a master notebook, organized by language and usefulness. And then there's this blog! Where I lay out all the things I've learned for myself in the hopes it will help me remember it all and help it make more sense.
<br><br>
The timeline is January to July of 2023. By July I'll be writting "Front-End Engineer" on my nameplate (Or more likely, my linkedin. Not as satisfying.) Right now it's mid-April, a month past halfway. My snowball is starting to gain momentum as it goes (I HOPE). I need to be 50% through the Front-End Engineer career path by the end of April, with a portfolio built and three sites to add to it (one of which is this one).
<br><br>
<xmp>function fizzy(){
  for(i=0; i <= 100; i++){
    if (i % 15 == 0){
      console.log("FizzBuzz")
    } else if(i % 5 == 0){
      console.log("Buzz")
    } else if (i % 3 == 0){
      console.log("Fizz")
    } else {
      console.log(i);
    }
  }
}

fizzy();</xmp>

<br><br>
In May I want to get 70% through the course, github and behance better be fully loaded plus updates to Linked in and Indeed. Lastly the React app I need to build should be well underway.
<br><br>
By June I'll be applying for jobs and pushing 90% on Codecademy. Basically a lot of all nighters. Are in my future.
